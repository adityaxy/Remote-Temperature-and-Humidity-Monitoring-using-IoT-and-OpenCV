# Following Electronic Equipments were used in this project
 Raspberry Pi 3,
 DHT22 (Temperature+Humidity sensor)
 Charger for Raspberry Pi
 
 The project is completed using Socket Programming. In this project the Raspberry Pi3 with DHT22 was acting as the client and A laptop was made server . Temperature and Humidity data sensed from DHT22 were sent to the laptop server by connecting to it. Usually, In socket programming two way communication can be done but in this, project , there is one way communication has been utilised.
 The Temperature and Humidity Data received on the remote server were plotted using matplotlibray.
